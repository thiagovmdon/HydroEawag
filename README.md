# HydroEawag
This repository holds my current research project for my PhD at Eawag where with the final purpose of understanding how environemntal change affects river basins I will make use of different Hydrological Anaylsis and Modelling. 

1. At the very begining I will focus on the data collection and pre-processing of streamflow for Europe, therefore so far there are some usefull scripts showing how to download and pre process daily streamflow information using Pandas, Geopandas, Selenium and other Python libraries.
